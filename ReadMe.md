## Folder Application
Description how the new Maps are stored.

According to selected way:

**File**

Loads Map from selected {Source} (FilePath)

Saves altered Map to "{Destination}/{Previous FileName} {Name}.map.gbx"

**Folder**

Loads all Maps from selected {Source} (FolderPath, no subfolders)

Saves altered Maps to "{Destination}/{Previous FileName} {Name}.map.gbx"

**FullFolder**

Loads all Maps from selected {Source} (FolderPath, including subfolders)

Saves altered Maps to "{Destination}/{Previous Subfolder}/{SubfolderName} {Name}/{Previous FileName} {Name}.map.gbx"

## Alteration Scripts
For often used Alterations, scripts can be made.

**Store** in "%appdata%/AutoAlteration/scripts/" as *.json

**Format**:
>     [
>       {
>         "Type": "{Type: File/Folder/FullFolder}",
>         "Name": "{Name: used for Files/Mapname}",
>         "Source": "{Path to your existing File/Folder}",
>         "Destination": "{Path to your save Folder}",
>         "Alterations": [
>           "{Your Alteration}", //Names as defined previously
>           ... //further Alterations
>         ]
>       },
>       ... //further Configurations
>     ]

Has to follow json formatting rules

# Development

## Known Issues
- The position of Items which are snapped onto something are read incorrectly, resulting in small offsets.
- Some Map Templates have different height offset when transforming to freeblock mode

> dotnet nuget add source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
-->

## RoadMap
- Modular Alterations:
    Make basic Alterations have constructor properties with maybe default properties (Surface for Surface Alterations, default offset for Effect-alts) they do execute the alteration
    Specific can extend/use basic ones by defining constructor properties they might add some more functionality
    opt: allow scripts and UI to define Properties

- find solution for DefaultRotation (maybe mark auto-placed blocks)

- apply on Nation Converter (check with BigBang)

- Roadmap Customblock Alterations:
  - Placement of reembeded Blocks (prob. issue with path)
  - Altering previously embedded blocks sometimes causes corruption
  - Full customblok-sets (Heavy -> light, Vanilla)

<!-- 
Opt.:
  Get WR for Map, extract releveant info (finish, cpOrder, nearest path rotation, Gearchanges)
  Multiple Maps Alterations (like Combined, sections joined)

  Maybe ReadMe's for technical explanations into according folders

# Technical Documentation
This Documentation contains
- Code Structure
- Data Strcucture/Definitions
- Some Process explanaitions

Further detailing Explanations are in code

## Code Structure
Description of basic Purpose of all code-Files

### AutoAlteration.cs
Interface to main Alteration Functionality

### Alterations/
Contains All the Implementations of Map Alterations

Files are named according to Alteration Categories of Altered Nadeo

### Core/
Contains all surrounding Functionality

**AlterationConfig:** Global Configurations considering Datastructure, Keywords, etc. (Needs to be loaded before any Alteration)

**AlterationLogic:** Implements the Process of Altering Maps or Customblocks

**AlterationScript:** Represents a Script of Alteration executions, which can be loaded from json and be run.

**DevUtils:** Some Tools used during Develoment

**SingleOrList:** A Listrepresentation which can be created from a single instance or a List

### CustoBlocks/
Contains all about alteration of Customblocks

**CustomBlock:** Represents a Customblock/Item which can be altered

**CustomBlockAlteration:** Abstract definition of CustomBlock Alterations which can be applied on Customblocks

**CustomSurfaceAlteration:** Implementations of CustomBlock Alterations for surface changes

**CustomOtherAlteration:** Some Varying Implementations of CustomBlock Alterations

### Inventory/
Conatins All about available Articles and selection of them.

**Article:** Represents a Article (Block/Item) which can be placed in a Map. Contains Keyword indexing and matching (Keywords according to it's name) 

**ArticleImport:** Import of Articles available in Trackmania 2020

**Inventory:** A set of Articles, allows the Selection of Articles based on Keywords (The full/base Inventory with all available Articles including customblocks is in Alteration.inventory)

**InventoryChange:** Changes which will can be applied on an Inventory (Including Base, but not during an Alteration)

**KeywordEdit:** A copy of an Inventory with cloned Articles, used to align to Articles with changed set of Keywords (change Keywords within Articles -> see which Articles originaly had those Keywords -> use Alignment to place/replace)

### Maps/
Contains fundamental functionality for the Alteration of Maps

**Alteration:** Abstract defintion of Alterations which can be applied on Maps

**Block:** Represents a Placed Block, although not actually placed in a Map but used for staging before getting placed in.

**Map:** Represents a Map which can loaded, altered and saved. Provides a range of functionality for modifications, often using Inventory (wrapping an actual map)

### Positioning/
Contains all functionality for processing of Positions (coords and rotation)

**Move:** Diffrent Implementations of modifications which can be applied on a Position (sometimes with Articleinfo)

**MoveChain:** A chain of diffrent Moves, which can be applied on a position

**Position:** Represents a Position of a Block (coords and rotation)

**PosUtils:** some Functions for easier creation of Movechains (used in Alteration and InventoryChange)

## Data Structure

### Global Data
In CommonApplicationData ("C:\ProgramData\AutoAlteration\data")
DataFolder modifyable per DevMode, DevPath (for Development)

**CustomBlocks/:** Base Folder for customblocks/Items which can be imported into Inventory (Inventorychange: CustomBlockFolder)

- **CustomBlocks/Vanilla:** Folder with all vanilla blocks/items as customblocks/items

**Inventory/:** Data defining Keywords and vanilla Articles

- **Inventory/BlockData:** Vanilla Articles in json format: [{Height,Width,Length,type,Name,Theme,Defaultrotation}]

- **Inventory/Keywords:** most Keywords used to split up Article Names (Orderd by Length)

- **Inventory/KeywordsStart:** Keywords which should be used first

- **Inventory/ToKeywords:** Keywords which have diffrent meaning depending on it's position behind or before a "To"-Keyword

- **Inventory/CustomBlockSets:** Keywords which are added for CustomblockSets, matching to the Folder Names in userdata/cache/

**Templates/** some files containing data copied in some Alterations

**dev/** some data exports for debugging

### User Data
in ApplicationData ("%appdata%/Autoalteration/")
Data which can vary depending on Usage

**Keywordfiles:** here additional Keywords can be defined, same purpose as in Global Data

**Cache/**
  **CustomBlockSets:** If a customblock set is needed it get's generated into it's Folder AutoAlteration/{SetName}/

**script/:** place to store Alteration scriptfiles

## Processes (To be documented)

### Map Alteration Process
From Map file to altered Map file (AutoAlteration.AlterFile)

1. Load Map using Map constructor

2. Call Alteration Process AlterationLogic.Alter

3. Clear embedded Blocks from last Map ("mapSpecific") from Folder and Inventory

4. If the set of alterations differs from last time, regenerate the Inventory
    1. Recreate Inventory from Vanilla Blockdata
    2. Apply Inventorychanges from all Alterations
    3. Apply some general modifications on Inventory for better Keyword Indexing

5. Add already embedded Customblocks to Inventory

6. For all customblockSets in Alterations, generate Set and add to Inventory for already embedded Blocks (Extracts to Temp Folder) 

7. Apply Alterations on Map (alteration.Run)

8. save map with new Name

## Trackmania circumstances

### Block Placement

**Vanilla Blocks**
- Class: CGameCtnBlock
- Name (blockModel): Name of Block in game
- Modes: normal (in grid), free, (is defined by block.isFree)
  - Normal: block.Coord defines position in grid (factor: (32m, 8m, 32m) ), block.Direction defines orientation as Cardinal Directions
  - Free: 
    - block.AbsolutePositionInMap: defines position as coordinates, 
    - block.PitchYawRoll: defines rotation as Vector (X=Yaw, Y=Pitch, Z=Roll)
      
      application order: 1. Yaw, 2. Roll, 3. Pitch

- Auto Alteration always places as Freeblock
- Some additional Properties: IsGhost, IsClip, Color, Skin, Bit21 (aka. IsAir)
  
  Per default they are just transfered from original block in Auto Alteration

**Vanilla Items**
- Class: CGameCtnAnchoredObject
- Name (Id): Name of Item in game
- Collection: here fixed to TM2020 (new Id(26))
- Author: here fixed to Nadeo
- item.AbsolutePositionInMap: defines position as coordinates, 
  - item.PitchYawRoll: defines rotation as Vector (X=Yaw, Y=Pitch, Z=Roll)
    
    application order: 1. Yaw, 2. Roll, 3. Pitch

- Some additional Properties: Color, Scale

**Custom Blocks**
- Requires block to be embedded in the Map
  - EntryName: "Blocks/" + block.name + ".Block.Gbx"
- Name (blockModel): block.name + ".Block.Gbx_CustomBlock";
- block.name can be a Path with Folders *Note
- Everything else: like normal Blocks

**Custom Items**
- Requires item to be embedded in the Map
  - EntryName: "Items/" + item.name + ".Item.Gbx"
- Name (Id): item.name + ".Item.Gbx"
- item.name can be a Path with Folders *Note
- Everything else: like normal Items

**\*Note CustomBlock Paths**
Usually when embedding customblocks they can have a full path.

In this Project full path's are only used for previously embedded Blocks.
