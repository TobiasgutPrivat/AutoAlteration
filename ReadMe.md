# Auto Alterations
Auto Alterations provides Functionality to automaticly create Trackmania Map-Alterations.

This Project is in early development, so there will probably be some Bugs and Problems. Contribution to the repository is very welcome, feel free to create pull requests.

## Usage
To use this, you need to download/clone the Project to run it localy.
It requires .NET installed and some way to run the solution (I use VSCode)

In the Program.cs file you can write Code for execution like in the example.
When using VSCode you can run the program.cs file just like a script by pressing F5.

The Alterations can be called via the Alteration classes in the src/Alterations/ Folder.
Multiple Alterations can be applied to one map.

## Known Issues
- Embedded Blocks/Items are not yet implemented.
- The Map stays validated which can result in impossible Authertimes
- A weird Problem when deleting boosters causing the map to not be loadable
