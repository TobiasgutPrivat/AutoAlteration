TODO 
integrate already embedded Blocks
Translate PivotPosition to Postion (maybe solved)
Mark which Alterations differ from Altered Nadeo
Issue with Altering Blocks, not placeable
Issue EmbeddedBlocks names -> flatten or use full path
Turn Blocktypes into inheriting classes

Testing:
Automatedtests for singular parts + Full processes
TestScript for complex selected

Definitions/Documentation:
Programm Interface
Folder Structures
Trackmania Properties (How embedding, positioning etc. works )

Split AutoAlterations.cs into Folder Interface/System
AlterScript.cs AlterationScripts
AlterLogic.cs: Alter Map/files/folders
Settings.cs: All data like Keywords, Paths (Singleton)

Opt.:
Performance: improve KeywordFilter, Alignment 
Think about Multiple finishes for reverse/combined etc.
Multi Map Alterations (Combined,Repeat/Multilap)
apply on Nation Converter (check with BigBang)

Alteration Ideen:
kleine lÃ¼cken (1m pro block nach aussen schieben)

# Auto Alterations
Auto Alterations provides Functionality to automaticly create Trackmania Map-Alterations.

This Project is based on the GBX.NET Framework from BigBang (Nationsconverter Guy).

It's still in early development, so there will probably be some Bugs and Problems. Contribution to the repository is very welcome, feel free to create pull requests.

If you encounter problems or you have some questions/ideas etc. please contact me on Discord <strong>(Tobias2g#5288)</strong>

[Guide to implementing Alterations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h8qPXhsJ8d_mmbTFmXU-r2CUU0RKPhpXaWtdgJrJLeM/edit?usp=sharing)
## How to use
UI-App recommended for normal use.

[Download](https://1drv.ms/u/c/bf971998d3da6c52/EdpzD5D_ModDlt00VIA7MOwBXzTzdBbICkWemIKLqgChnw?e=hie2hq)

Also Alteration Scripts can be defined using json files. [Example](https://1drv.ms/u/c/bf971998d3da6c52/EQbNHWn08upIkWh903vYe6YBgC39OcYKtmoFAoxtys3Pmg?e=289yQq)

To have more control, or to develop some stuff you need to setup the full Project (see Installation)

## Note TODO Blocks

**requires**:
constructor from Item/Block
place into map

one base class to allow transfer as one list: 
Block: represent blocks which are already available (previously embedded/Vanilla Inventory)

Item(Block) for AnchoredObject: represent blocks which are already available in (previously embedded/Vanilla Inventory)

CustomBlock(Block) custom Blocks -> add path to constructor. requires embedding in map 
CustomItem(Item) custom Items -> add path to constructor. requires embedding in map

## Note TODO PositionChange
**constructor**: save Properties to move with
