TODO 
Mark which Alterations differ from Altered Nadeo
Fix Some Blocks wrong rotation -> Comments in Block.cs

Define Alteration Properties for Alterations
Apply Alteration Properties in UI

Rotation subtraction incorrect, testable using Tilted, but so far nowhere needed (probably rotation order issue)

Roadmap Customblock Alterations:
1. Issue with air mode
2. Issue Altering of EmbeddedBlocks don't appear ingame as embedded (can be done first)
   A Thought -> For Customblocks, it could be defined that the ones from AutoAlt do have unique names, and for mapspecific the Path would be included, mapspecific should not need to be matching to Vanilla Blocks
3. Opt. Solution for StaticModel-customblocks

Opt.:
Get WR for Map, extract releveant info (finish, cpOrder, nearest path rotation, Gearchanges)
Multiple Maps Alterations (like Combined, sections joined)
Make Configurable Alterations
apply on Nation Converter (check with BigBang)

Maybe make Keywords not case sensitive

# Auto Alterations
Auto Alterations provides Functionality to automaticly create Trackmania Map-Alterations.

This Project is based on the GBX.NET Framework from BigBang (Nationsconverter Guy).

It's still in early development, so there will probably be some Bugs and Problems. Contribution to the repository is very welcome, feel free to create pull requests.

If you encounter problems or you have some questions/ideas etc. please contact me on Discord <strong>(Tobias2g#5288)</strong>

[Guide to implementing Alterations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h8qPXhsJ8d_mmbTFmXU-r2CUU0RKPhpXaWtdgJrJLeM/edit?usp=sharing)
## How to use
UI-App recommended for normal use.

[Download](https://1drv.ms/u/c/bf971998d3da6c52/Ec43uQOtQZdInmv-en32fmAB_-tn0nyNPD2hQr8z4424sw?e=ttExio)

Also Alteration Scripts can be defined using json files. [Example](https://1drv.ms/u/c/bf971998d3da6c52/EQbNHWn08upIkWh903vYe6YBgC39OcYKtmoFAoxtys3Pmg?e=289yQq)

To have more control, or to develop some stuff you need to setup the full Project (see Installation)

## Folder Application
Description how the new Maps are stored.

According to selected way:

**File**

Loads Map from selected {Source} (FilePath)

Saves altered Map to "{Destination}/{Previous FileName} {Name}.map.gbx"

**Folder**

Loads all Maps from selected {Source} (FolderPath, no subfolders)

Saves altered Maps to "{Destination}/{Previous FileName} {Name}.map.gbx"

**FullFolder**

Loads all Maps from selected {Source} (FolderPath, including subfolders)

Saves altered Maps to "{Destination}/{Previous Subfolder}/{SubfolderName} {Name}/{Previous FileName} {Name}.map.gbx"

## Alteration Scripts
For often used Alterations, scripts can be made.

**Store** in "%appdata%/AutoAlteration/scripts/" as *.json

**Format**:
>     [
>       {
>         "Type": "{Type: File/Folder/FullFolder}",
>         "Name": "{Name: used for Files/Mapname}",
>         "Source": "{Path to your existing File/Folder}",
>         "Destination": "{Path to your save Folder}",
>         "Alterations": [
>           "{Your Alteration}", //Names as defined previously
>           ... //further Alterations
>         ]
>       },
>       ... //further Configurations
>     ]

Has to follow json formatting rules

## Known Issues
- The position of Items which are snapped onto something are read incorrectly, resulting in small offsets.
- Some Map Templates have different height offset when transforming to freeblock mode

## Code Structure
Description of basic Purpose of all code-Files

### AutoAlteration.cs
Interface to main Alteration Functionality

### Alterations/
Contains All the Implementations of Map Alterations

Files are named according to Alteration Categories of Altered Nadeo

### Core/
Contains all surrounding Functionality

**AlterationConfig:** Global Configurations considering Datastructure, Keywords, etc. (Needs to be loaded before any Alteration)

**AlterationLogic:** Implements the Process of Altering Maps or Customblocks

**AlterationScript:** Represents a Script of Alteration executions, which can be loaded from json and be run.

**DevUtils:** Some Tools used during Develoment

**SingleOrList:** A Listrepresentation which can be created from a single instance or a List

**CustomSurfaceAlteration:** Implementations of CustomBlock Alterations for surface changes

**CustomOtherAlteration:** Some Varying Implementations of CustomBlock Alterations

### Inventory/
Conatins All about available Articles and selection of them.

**Article:** Represents a Article (Block/Item) which can be placed in a Map. Contains Keyword indexing and matching (Keywords according to it's name) 

**ArticleImport:** Import of Articles available in Trackmania 2020

**Inventory:** A set of Articles, allows the Selection of Articles based on Keywords (The full/base Inventory with all available Articles including customblocks is in Alteration.inventory)

**InventoryChange:** Changes which will can be applied on an Inventory (Including Base, but not during an Alteration)

**KeywordEdit:** A copy of an Inventory with cloned Articles, used to align to Articles with changed set of Keywords (change Keywords within Articles -> see which Articles originaly had those Keywords -> use Alignment to place/replace)

### Maps/
Contains fundamental functionality for the Alteration of Maps

**Alteration:** Abstract defintion of Alterations which can be applied on Maps

**Block:** Represents a Placed Block, although not actually placed in a Map but used for staging before getting placed in.

**Map:** Represents a Map which can loaded, altered and saved. Provides a range of functionality for modifications, often using Inventory (wrapping an actual map)

### Positioning/
Contains all functionality for processing of Positions (coords and rotation)

**Move:** Diffrent Implementations of modifications which can be applied on a Position (sometimes with Articleinfo)

**MoveChain:** A chain of diffrent Moves, which can be applied on a position

**Position:** Represents a Position of a Block (coords and rotation)

**PosUtils:** some Functions for easier creation of Movechains (used in Alteration and InventoryChange)

## Data Structure

### Global Data
In CommonApplicationData ("C:\ProgramData\AutoAlteration\data")
DataFolder modifyable per DevMode, DevPath (for Development)

**CustomBlocks/:** Base Folder for customblocks/Items which can be imported into Inventory (Inventorychange: CustomBlockFolder)

- **CustomBlocks/Vanilla:** Folder with all vanilla blocks/items as customblocks/items

**Inventory/:** Data defining Keywords and vanilla Articles

- **Inventory/BlockData:** Vanilla Articles in json format: [{Height,Width,Length,type,Name,Theme,Defaultrotation}]

- **Inventory/Keywords:** most Keywords used to split up Article Names (Orderd by Length)

- **Inventory/KeywordsStart:** Keywordswhich should be used first

**LowCubeLayer:** used for invisible blocks

**IceSkin:** used for SnowScenery Wall skin

**script/:** place to store Alteration scriptfiles

**dev/** some data exports for debugging

### User Data
in ApplicationData ("%appdata%/Autoalteration/")
Data which can vary depending on Usage

**Keywords/KeywordsStart:** here additional Keywords can be defined

**CustomBlockSets:** If a customblock set is needed it get's generated into it's Folder AutoAlteration/{SetName}/

## Processes (To be documented)

### Map Alteration
From Map file to altered Map file (AutoAlteration.AlterFile)

1. Load Map using Map constructor

2. Call Alteration Process AlterationLogic.Alter

3. Clear embedded Blocks from last Map ("mapSpecific") from Folder and Inventory

4. If the set of alterations differs from last time, regenerate the Inventory
    1. Recreate Inventory from Vanilla Blockdata
    2. Apply Inventorychanges from all Alterations
    3. Apply some general modifications on Inventory for better Keyword Indexing

5. Add already embedded Customblocks to Inventory

6. For all customblockSets in Alterations, generate Set and add to Inventory for already embedded Blocks (Extracts to Temp Folder) 

7. Apply Alterations on Map (alteration.Run)

8. save map with new Name

### CustomBlock Alteration

### Inventory Selection

### InventoryEdit Alignment

## Trackmania circumstances

### Block Placement

**Vanilla Blocks**
- Class: CGameCtnBlock
- Name (blockModel): Name of Block in game
- Modes: normal (in grid), free, (is defined by block.isFree)
  - Normal: block.Coord defines position in grid (factor: (32m, 8m, 32m) ), block.Direction defines orientation as Cardinal Directions
  - Free: 
    - block.AbsolutePositionInMap: defines position as coordinates, 
    - block.PitchYawRoll: defines rotation as Vector (X=Yaw, Y=Pitch, Z=Roll)
      
      application order: 1. Yaw, 2. Roll, 3. Pitch

- Auto Alteration always places as Freeblock
- Some additional Properties: IsGhost, IsClip, Color, Skin, Bit21 (aka. IsAir)
  
  Per default they are just transfered from original block in Auto Alteration

**Vanilla Items**
- Class: CGameCtnAnchoredObject
- Name (Id): Name of Item in game
- Collection: here fixed to TM2020 (new Id(26))
- Author: here fixed to Nadeo
- item.AbsolutePositionInMap: defines position as coordinates, 
  - item.PitchYawRoll: defines rotation as Vector (X=Yaw, Y=Pitch, Z=Roll)
    
    application order: 1. Yaw, 2. Roll, 3. Pitch

- Some additional Properties: Color, Scale

**Custom Blocks**
- Requires block to be embedded in the Map
  - EntryName: "Blocks/" + block.name + ".Block.Gbx"
- Name (blockModel): block.name + ".Block.Gbx_CustomBlock";
- block.name can be a Path with Folders *Note
- Everything else: like normal Blocks

**Custom Items**
- Requires item to be embedded in the Map
  - EntryName: "Items/" + item.name + ".Item.Gbx"
- Name (Id): item.name + ".Item.Gbx"
- item.name can be a Path with Folders *Note
- Everything else: like normal Items

**\*Note CustomBlock Paths**
Usually when embedding customblocks they can have a full path.

In this Project only the Name is used for indexing and when embedding new Blocks, for simplicity reasons.

**Potential Problem** this can cause issues if two blocks have the same name but diffrent Path
